# fullstack-user-management-Project
The projects Frontend is fully made up of Vite.js(reactjs), and the backend fastAPI(python), I used the database MySQL Workbench. There is one connection made by Dbeaver with the Workbench. I used Postman and Swagger UI to test the backend and Database connections.
